# e107-v2.x-Language-Packs
Language Packs for v2.x - Feel free to contribute via pull-request. 

When contributing, please make sure you edit `e107_languages/YourLanguage/YourLanguage.xml` so that it contains the version of e107 the language-pack has been translated for and the date you made your last edit. 

eg. If you were updating the Spanish pack for e107 v2.1.2, in e107_languages/Spanish/Spanish.xml you would modify ***compatibility*** and ***date*** to look like this: 

`<e107Language name="Spanish" compatibility="2.1.2" date="2016-10-28" >`
